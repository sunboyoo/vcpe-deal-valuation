                    Equity Deals</h1>
                <p>
                    This platform provides a comprehensive and accessible solution for MBA and BBA students to compute
                    the valuation of various securities associated with venture capital and private equity transactions.
                    Originally created by Professor Klaas Baks from Emory University's Goizueta Business School, this
                    tool has been meticulously converted from an Excel-based model into an intuitive online interface.
                    Our goal is to offer an alternative resource for students who may not have access to Excel,
                    enhancing their learning experience in financial valuation.
